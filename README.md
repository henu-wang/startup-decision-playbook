# Startup Decision Playbook

A structured decision playbook for startup founders covering the critical choices that make or break companies: fundraising, hiring, pivoting, pricing, partnerships, and scaling. Each play includes decision criteria, red flags, and templates used by successful founders.

## Why a Playbook?

Startup founders face hundreds of high-stakes decisions with incomplete information and crushing time pressure. Without a framework, decisions default to gut instinct — which is often wrong in novel situations. This playbook gives you structured approaches for the decisions that matter most, so you can save your creative energy for problems that truly require it.

"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment." — this playbook helps you skip some of the bad judgment by learning from those who came before.

## The Plays

### Phase 1: Idea & Validation

| Play | Decision | Key Question |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **P1.1** | Problem Selection | Is this a top-3 problem for our target user? |
| **P1.2** | Market Sizing | Is the TAM large enough (>$1B) and accessible? |
| **P1.3** | Solution Design | Are users pulling this from us, or are we pushing? |
| **P1.4** | MVP Scope | What's the minimum we can build to test our riskiest assumption? |

### Phase 2: Building & Hiring

| Play | Decision | Key Question |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **P2.1** | Co-founder Selection | Do we have complementary skills AND aligned values? |
| **P2.2** | First 10 Hires | Are they missionaries or mercenaries? |
| **P2.3** | Build vs. Buy | Is this a core competency or a commodity? |
| **P2.4** | Technical Architecture | Will this scale 10x without a rewrite? |

### Phase 3: Growth & Fundraising

| Play | Decision | Key Question |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **P3.1** | When to Fundraise | Do we have enough traction to command good terms? |
| **P3.2** | Investor Selection | Do they add strategic value beyond capital? |
| **P3.3** | Pricing Strategy | Is our pricing aligned with value delivered? |
| **P3.4** | Channel Selection | Which channels have the best LTV:CAC ratio? |

### Phase 4: Scale & Pivot

| Play | Decision | Key Question |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **P4.1** | When to Pivot | Are we iterating toward product-market fit or away from it? |
| **P4.2** | When to Scale | Do unit economics work at 10x current volume? |
| **P4.3** | International Expansion | Is the marginal market worth the complexity cost? |
| **P4.4** | M&A Decisions | Build, buy, or partner? |

## Sample Play: When to Pivot

### Decision Criteria for Pivoting

- [ ] We've talked to 50+ users and can't find consistent demand
- [ ] Our best users love a feature that's tangential to our core product
- [ ] Unit economics don't improve with iteration
- [ ] The market has fundamentally changed since we started
- [ ] A competitor has made our approach unviable

### Red Flags (Don't Pivot If)

- You haven't given the current approach enough time (< 6 months)
- You're pivoting away from discomfort rather than toward opportunity
- The team is demoralized and pivoting is a morale play, not a strategy play
