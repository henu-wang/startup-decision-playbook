## The Startup Decision Stack

Startup decisions cascade. Early decisions constrain later ones. The highest-leverage decisions are:

```
                    Impact
                      ↑
    What to build     │  ●
                      │
    Who to hire       │     ●
                      │
    How to fund       │        ●
                      │
    When to pivot     │           ●
                      │
    When to quit      │              ●
                      └────────────────→ Difficulty
```

**Principle:** Make the biggest decisions the slowest. Make reversible decisions fast.

| Decision Type | Reversibility | Speed |
|--------------|:-:|:-:|
| Product features | High | Fast (days) |
| Marketing channels | High | Fast (weeks) |
| Pricing model | Medium | Medium (months) |
| Hiring | Medium | Medium (careful then fast) |
| Co-founder choice | Low | Very slow |
| Funding structure | Low | Very slow |
| Market choice | Low | Very slow |

## Phase 1: Validation Decisions

### Should I pursue this idea?

```markdown
## Idea Validation Scorecard

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|-----------|:-:|---------|
| **Problem severity** — How painful is this problem? | | |
| **Frequency** — How often do people encounter it? | | |
| **Willingness to pay** — Will they pay to solve it? | | |
| **Market size** — Enough potential customers? | | |
| **Founder-market fit** — Do I have unfair advantages here? | | |
| **Trend alignment** — Is this getting more or less relevant? | | |
| **Defensibility** — Can I build a moat? | | |
| **Personal passion** — Can I endure 5-10 hard years on this? | | |
| **Total** | **/40** | |

### Scoring
- 32-40: Strong signal — proceed to validation
- 24-31: Promising — needs more evidence
- 16-23: Weak — significant concerns to address
- Below 16: Move on to a different idea
```

### Customer Discovery Checklist

```markdown
## Customer Discovery: [Idea]

### Interviews completed: ___ / 30 (minimum)

### Key questions asked:
1. "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
2. "What did you do about it?"
3. "What do you currently use to solve this?"
4. "What do you hate about your current solution?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
6. "Would you pay $X for a solution?" / "How much would you pay?"

### Patterns found:
| Theme | Frequency | Quotes |
|-------|:-:|--------|
| | /30 | |
| | /30 | |
| | /30 | |

### Validation signals:
- [ ] 5+ people described the same problem unprompted
- [ ] 3+ people are actively spending money/time on workarounds
- [ ] At least 1 person said "Can I buy this now?" or offered to pre-pay
- [ ] The problem is getting worse, not better

### Decision: [Proceed / Pivot idea / Abandon]
```

### MVP Scope Decision

**The question:** What is the absolute minimum product that tests our core hypothesis?

```markdown
## MVP Definition: [Product]

### Core hypothesis:
"We believe that [target customer] will [action] because [reason]."

### Features: Must-have vs. Nice-to-have
| Feature | Must-have | Nice-to-have | Why? |
|---------|:-:|:-:|------|
| | ☐ | ☐ | |
| | ☐ | ☐ | |
| | ☐ | ☐ | |
| | ☐ | ☐ | |

### Rule: Ship with ONLY the must-haves.
If you can't explain why a feature is essential to testing the hypothesis, cut it.

### Success criteria:
- Metric: ___
- Target: ___
- Timeline: ___
```

---

## Phase 2: Building Decisions

### Hire or Outsource?

| Factor | Hire Full-Time | Outsource/Contract |
|--------|:-:|:-:|
| Core competency | ✅ Always hire for core | |
| Speed to start | Slower (recruiting) | ✅ Faster |
| Long-term cost | Lower per hour | Higher per hour |
| Quality control | ✅ More control | Less control |
| Knowledge retention | ✅ Stays in company | Walks out the door |
| Flexibility | Less (fixed cost) | ✅ More (variable cost) |

**Rule of thumb:** Hire for your core differentiator. Outsource everything else until you reach product-market fit.

### Co-founder Compatibility

```markdown
## Co-founder Assessment: [Name]

### Complementary skills
| Area | My Strength (1-5) | Their Strength (1-5) | Gap Covered? |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Technical | | | |
| Product/design | | | |
| Sales/marketing | | | |
| Operations | | | |
| Finance/fundraising | | | |

### Alignment check
| Question | Aligned? | Notes |
|----------|:-:|-------|
| Vision for the company in 5 years | Yes/No | |
| Risk tolerance | Yes/No | |
| Work ethic expectations | Yes/No | |
| Equity split comfort | Yes/No | |
| Decision-making style | Yes/No | |
| Exit preferences | Yes/No | |
| Financial needs (runway) | Yes/No | |

### Red flags
- [ ] We've never disagreed (means someone isn't being honest)
- [ ] We've never worked together before
- [ ] They want co-founder title but not co-founder commitment
- [ ] Different financial pressures (one needs salary, other doesn't)
- [ ] Can't agree on equity
```

### Pricing Decision

```markdown
## Pricing Strategy

### Cost-plus (floor)
- Variable cost per unit: $___
- Fixed costs allocated: $___
- Minimum price to break even: $___

### Value-based (ceiling)
- Customer's current spend on alternatives: $___
- Value our solution creates: $___
- Willingness to pay (from interviews): $___

### Competitive reference
| Competitor | Price | What they include |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

### Pricing decision
| Model | Price | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Option A: ___ | $__ | |
| Option B: ___ | $__ | |
| Option C: ___ | $__ | |

### Test plan

## Phase 3: Growth Decisions

### Product-Market Fit Assessment

```markdown
## PMF Assessment: [Product]

### Sean Ellis Survey
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- Very disappointed: ___% (target: >40%)
- Somewhat disappointed: ___%
- Not disappointed: ___%

### Leading Indicators
| Indicator | Current | Target | PMF? |
|-----------|---------|--------|:-:|
| Organic growth rate | | >50% | |
| Retention (Month 3) | | >40% | |
| NPS | | >50 | |
| Word-of-mouth referrals | | >25% of new users | |
| Usage frequency | | Daily/Weekly active | |

### Verdict
- [ ] Strong PMF — invest in growth
- [ ] Emerging PMF — iterate on retention
- [ ] No PMF — iterate on product or pivot
```

### Channel Selection

```markdown
## Growth Channel Evaluation

| Channel | CAC Estimate | Scalability (1-5) | Time to Results | Fit (1-5) |
|---------|-------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Content/SEO | | | | |
| Paid search (Google) | | | | |
| Paid social (Meta) | | | | |
| Sales (outbound) | | | | |
| Partnerships | | | | |
| Referral/viral | | | | |
| Community | | | | |
| PR/media | | | | |

### Rule: Test 2-3 channels. Double down on the one that works. Ignore the rest.

### Bull's-eye Framework
1. Outer ring: Brainstorm all possible channels
2. Middle ring: Select 3 most promising
3. Inner ring: Test and identify THE channel
```

## Phase 4: Scaling Decisions

### When to Raise Funding

```markdown
## Fundraising Decision

### Do we need to raise?
- [ ] Current runway: ___ months
- [ ] Monthly burn: $___
- [ ] Revenue covers ___% of burn
- [ ] We have clear use of funds (not "figuring it out")
- [ ] Raising now will accelerate a specific metric: ___

### What stage are we?
| Stage | Typical Round | What You Need to Show |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Pre-seed | $100K-$500K | Team + idea + early validation |
| Seed | $500K-$3M | MVP + early traction + PMF signal |
| Series A | $3M-$15M | PMF + repeatable growth + unit economics |
| Series B | $15M-$50M | Growth at scale + clear path to profitability |

### Bootstrapping vs. Raising
| Factor | Bootstrap | Raise |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Control | ✅ 100% yours | Shared with investors |
| Speed | Slower | ✅ Faster |
| Risk | Lower (personal) | Higher (expectations) |
| Upside | 100% of smaller outcome | Smaller % of bigger outcome |
| Pressure | Customer-driven | ✅/❌ Investor-driven |
```

### Hiring Plan

```markdown
## Hiring Decision: Role [___]

### Do we need this hire?
- [ ] This role will directly impact our #1 metric
- [ ] We can't achieve our 6-month goals without this role
- [ ] We have enough runway to support this hire for 12+ months
- [ ] This can't be done by existing team or contractors

### Role scorecard
| Must-Have Skill | Assessment Method |
|----------------|-------------------|
| | Interview Q / Test / Reference |
| | |
| | |

### Culture fit criteria
| Value | How We Test |
|-------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

### Compensation framework
- Market rate range: $___-$___
- Our offer: $___
- Equity: ___% (vesting: 4 years, 1-year cliff)
```

## The Hardest Decisions

### Pivot vs. Persevere

```markdown
## Pivot Analysis

### Evidence for persevering:
| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|---------|
| Some users love the product | |
| Metrics are trending up (even slowly) | |
| We haven't fully tested our hypothesis | |
| Market conditions haven't changed | |

### Evidence for pivoting:
| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|---------|
| No meaningful growth in 3+ months | |
| Users aren't retaining | |
| CAC is unsustainably high | |
| We've tested our core hypothesis and it's wrong | |
| A better opportunity emerged from what we learned | |

### Pivot options:
| Pivot Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Zoom-in | One feature becomes the product | Instagram pivoted from Burbn |
| Zoom-out | Product becomes one feature of larger product | |
| Customer segment | Same product, different customers | |
| Platform | App → platform or vice versa | |
| Value capture | Change monetization | |
| Channel | Change distribution method | |
| Technology | Same problem, different technology | |

### Decision: [Persevere / Pivot to ___]
```

### When to Shut Down

**Honest assessment signals:**

- [ ] Runway < 3 months with no path to revenue or funding
- [ ] Founders are burnt out and no longer believe in the mission
- [ ] Market has fundamentally shifted against you
- [ ] After 12+ months, no evidence of product-market fit
- [ ] Key team members are leaving and can't be replaced
- [ ] The opportunity cost of continuing exceeds the potential upside

> "If you're going to fail, fail fast." — But also: don't quit on a bad day. Make shutdown decisions when you're calm and have data, not when you're exhausted.

## Decision Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | The Fix |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Building in a vacuum** | No customer conversations | Talk to 30 customers before building |
| **Analysis paralysis** | Spreadsheets instead of shipping | Set decision deadlines |
| **Hippo (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)** | The founder's hunch overrides data | Run experiments |
| **Premature scaling** | Hiring/spending before PMF | Validate first, scale second |
| **Sunk cost trap** | "We've invested too much to quit" | Evaluate forward-looking ROI only |
| **Feature factory** | Building features instead of solving problems | Return to customer problems |
| **Vanity metrics** | Celebrating downloads, page views | Focus on revenue, retention, NPS |
| **Consensus seeking** | Waiting for everyone to agree | Disagree and commit |
