## How to Use This Playbook

Each chapter addresses a specific class of decisions. Within each chapter you will find:

- **Context**: When does this decision arise?
- **Framework**: A structured approach to evaluating options
- **Red Flags**: Warning signs that indicate a poor decision
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use tools for your specific situation

Founders who maintain a clear set of operating principles make faster, more consistent decisions under pressure. If you have not yet defined your founding principles, consider using a tool like [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) to document the core beliefs that guide your company.

## Chapter 1: Pivot vs Persevere

### The Pivot Decision Framework

The decision to pivot is one of the hardest a founder will face. Use this framework to separate signal from noise:

**Step 1: Define Your Current Hypothesis**

Write down in one sentence what you believe to be true about your market, customer, and solution:

```
We believe [customer segment] has [problem] and will pay [price] for [solution].
```

**Step 2: Evaluate Evidence**

| Evidence Type | Supporting | Neutral | Contradicting |
|---------------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Customer interviews (n=__) | | | |
| Usage data / retention | | | |
| Revenue / willingness to pay | | | |
| Market size validation | | | |
| Competitive landscape | | | |

**Step 3: Apply the Rule of Three**

Pivot if three or more of these are true:

1. Retention is flat or declining after 3+ months of effort
2. You cannot articulate why customers choose you over alternatives
3. Your best customers are not the segment you are targeting
4. Revenue growth has stalled despite increased investment
5. You dread working on the current product
6. Every customer wants something different

### Types of Pivots

| Pivot Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Customer Segment** | Same product, different customer | Slack (gaming to enterprise) |
| **Problem** | Same customer, different problem | Instagram (check-ins to photo sharing) |
| **Solution** | Same problem, different approach | Netflix (DVD mail to streaming) |
| **Channel** | Same product, different distribution | Many B2C to B2B2C pivots |
| **Revenue Model** | Same product, different monetization | Ads to SaaS subscription |
| **Technology** | Same outcome, different tech stack | On-premise to cloud |

### Pivot Signal Checklist

Strong pivot signals (act on 3+):

- [ ] Core metric has not improved in 8+ weeks despite focused effort
- [ ] Users who do retain use a feature you consider secondary
- [ ] Sales cycle is 3x longer than industry benchmark
- [ ] Customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value by 2x+
- [ ] You keep hearing the same objection and cannot solve it
- [ ] Your team morale is sustained only by fundraising hope, not customer love

## Chapter 2: Hiring Decisions

### When to Hire

The default should be **not** to hire. Every person you add increases communication overhead and burn rate. Hire only when:

| Criteria | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Pain is acute | A specific person is working 60+ hours/week on one function for 4+ weeks |
| Work is recurring | The tasks will exist for 6+ months (not a one-time project) |
| ROI is clear | The hire will generate or save more than their fully loaded cost within 6 months |
| Cash runway supports it | You have 12+ months of runway after the hire |

### The Hire-or-Not Scorecard

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Is this role critical to the next milestone? | __ | |
| Can existing team members cover this? | __ | (5 = no, they cannot) |
| Is the work well-defined enough to delegate? | __ | |
| Do we have runway to absorb a slow ramp-up? | __ | |
| Can we attract the right talent at our stage? | __ | |
| **Total (out of 25)** | __ | Hire if 18+ |

### Early Hire Archetypes

| Hire Number | Typical Role | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 1-3 | Engineers (full-stack) | Build the core product |
| 4-5 | First non-technical: sales or customer success | Validate revenue and gather feedback |
| 6-8 | Domain specialists | Depends on your market (ML engineer, designer, etc.) |
| 9-10 | Operations: finance, HR, or office manager | Founder should not be doing payroll |

### Founder vs Hire Decision

| Situation | Do It Yourself | Hire |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| 0-10 customers | Always | Too early |
| 10-50 customers | For learning | Consider for execution |
| 50-200 customers | Transition out | Necessary |
| 200+ customers | Bottleneck | Critical |

---

## Chapter 3: Fundraising Timing

### Should You Raise at All?

| Factor | Bootstrap | Raise Venture Capital |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Market timing | Not winner-take-all | Winner-take-all dynamics |
| Capital efficiency | Revenue covers costs quickly | Significant upfront investment needed |
| Growth rate needed | 20-50% YoY is fine | Need 3x+ YoY to justify VC |
| Founder goals | Lifestyle / long-term ownership | Scale fast / exit |
| Unit economics | Positive from day one | Negative initially, positive at scale |

### The Fundraising Readiness Checklist

Before approaching investors, ensure you can check off at least 7 of 10:

- [ ] Clear problem statement validated by 20+ customer conversations
- [ ] Working product (not just a prototype)
- [ ] At least 3 months of revenue data (or equivalent traction metric)
- [ ] Month-over-month growth of 15%+ on a key metric
- [ ] Understanding of unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- [ ] Specific use of funds (not "general working capital")
- [ ] 18-month financial model with assumptions documented
- [ ] Target investor list of 30+ relevant investors
- [ ] At least 2 warm introductions to target investors
- [ ] Pitch deck that tells a compelling story in 12 slides or fewer

### Round Sizing Framework

| Round | Typical Range | Milestone to Achieve |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Seed | $250K-$1M | Product-market fit signals |
| Seed | $1M-$4M | Repeatable customer acquisition |
| Series A | $5M-$15M | Scalable go-to-market engine |
| Series B | $15M-$50M | Market leadership in core segment |

**Rule of thumb:** Raise enough to reach the next fundable milestone + 6 months buffer. Raising too much dilutes unnecessarily; too little creates existential pressure.

### Investor Selection Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | Investor A | Investor B |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Domain expertise in your market | 5 | __ | __ |
| Useful network (customers, hires) | 4 | __ | __ |
| Follow-on fund capacity | 3 | __ | __ |
| Founder references (check 3+) | 5 | __ | __ |
| Alignment on timeline and vision | 4 | __ | __ |
| Board involvement style | 3 | __ | __ |
| Brand signal to future investors | 2 | __ | __ |

## Chapter 4: Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Models Comparison

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| **Flat-rate subscription** | Simple products, SMB | Predictable, easy to sell | Leaves money on table for large customers |
| **Per-seat** | Collaboration tools | Scales with org size | Discourages adoption within orgs |
| **Usage-based** | Infrastructure, APIs | Aligns cost with value | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Tiered** | Products with varied personas | Captures different willingness to pay | Complexity in packaging |
| **Freemium** | Products with viral potential | Low barrier to entry | Conversion rates typically 2-5% |
| **Enterprise custom** | Complex B2B | Maximizes deal size | Slow sales cycles |

### The Pricing Decision Tree

```
Is your product used by individuals or teams?
|
+-- Individuals
|   +-- Is value proportional to usage? --> Usage-based
|   +-- Is value roughly equal per user? --> Flat-rate or tiered
|
+-- Teams
    +-- Does value scale with team size? --> Per-seat
    +-- Does value scale with usage volume? --> Usage-based
    +-- Is value primarily for the org, not individuals? --> Tiered or enterprise
```

### When to Change Pricing

**Raise prices when:**
- Churn is below 3% monthly and customers say your product is a "no-brainer"
- You have not raised prices in 12+ months
- Customers negotiate less than 10% of the time
- Your product has significantly more features than at last pricing

**Lower prices when:**
- Win rate on proposals is below 20%
- Sales cycles exceed industry benchmark by 2x
- Customers consistently cite price as the primary objection
- You are optimizing for market share in a winner-take-all market

## Chapter 5: Market Entry Decisions

### Beachhead Market Selection

Score each potential segment:

| Criteria | Segment A | Segment B | Segment C |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Urgency of the problem (1-10) | __ | __ | __ |
| Willingness to pay (1-10) | __ | __ | __ |
| Ease of reaching them (1-10) | __ | __ | __ |
| Market size ($) | __ | __ | __ |
| Competitive intensity (1-10, 10=low) | __ | __ | __ |
| Adjacent market potential | __ | __ | __ |

Choose the segment with the highest total score. Dominate it before expanding.

### Go-to-Market Strategy Matrix

| ACV (Annual Contract Value) | Strategy | Sales Motion |
|----------------------------|----------|-------------|
| < $1K | Self-serve | Product-led growth |
| $1K-$10K | Inside sales | Demo, trial, close |
| $10K-$100K | Field sales | Multi-stakeholder, consultative |
| > $100K | Enterprise sales | Long cycle, POC, procurement |

---

## Chapter 6: Product Scope Decisions

### Feature Prioritization Framework

Use the RICE framework:

| Feature | Reach | Impact (1-3) | Confidence (%) | Effort (person-weeks) | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| Feature A | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| Feature B | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| Feature C | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ |

```
RICE = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort
```

### Build vs Buy vs Partner

| Factor | Build | Buy (SaaS) | Partner |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Time to market | Slow | Fast | Medium |
| Customization | Full | Limited | Negotiable |
| Ongoing cost | Engineering time | Subscription | Revenue share |
| Strategic value | High if core | Low | Medium |
| Best for | Core differentiators | Commodity functions | Distribution |

## Chapter 7: Co-founder Decisions

### Co-founder Compatibility Checklist

Before committing, align on these:

- [ ] Vision: Where should the company be in 5 years?
- [ ] Values: What is more important — growth or profitability? Speed or quality?
- [ ] Roles: Who owns what? (Product, engineering, sales, fundraising)
- [ ] Commitment: Full-time? When? What if one person wants to leave?
- [ ] Equity: Agreed split with 4-year vesting and 1-year cliff
- [ ] Conflict resolution: How do you make decisions when you disagree?
- [ ] Financial runway: How long can each person go without salary?
- [ ] Work style: Remote/office? Hours? Communication preferences?

### Red Flags in Co-founder Relationships

- You have never disagreed about anything (avoidance, not alignment)
- One person dominates all decisions
- Equity discussions keep getting postponed
- You have different definitions of "success"
- You have not worked together on anything before

## Chapter 8: When to Shut Down

The decision to shut down is the hardest. Consider it when:

| Signal | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Runway remaining | < 3 months with no path to revenue or funding |
| Founder motivation | All co-founders have lost conviction for 2+ months |
| Market feedback | 50+ customer conversations yield no consistent demand signal |
| Retention | Month-1 retention below 10% after 3+ iterations |
| Team | Key team members are leaving and cannot be replaced |

**Shutting down is not failure.** It is a decision to redeploy your most valuable resource — your time — to something with a better chance of success.
